# Squad Scramble Development Progress

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Implementation (COMPLETED)

### What's Been Built

#### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/20250110_squad_scramble.sql`)
- ✅ `team_generations` table - stores generation configs and metadata
- ✅ `teams` table - individual teams per generation
- ✅ `team_members` table - participant assignments with captain tracking
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies for both free and paid tiers
- ✅ Automatic `is_current` flag management via trigger function
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- ✅ Updated `events` table with `available_tools` column

#### 2. Utility Functions

**Team Generation (`src/utils/squadScramble.js`)**
- ✅ `generateTeamsByCount()` - create N teams, balanced distribution
- ✅ `generateTeamsBySize()` - create teams of size X
- ✅ `assignRandomCaptains()` - auto-select team captains
- ✅ `setCaptain()` - manually assign captain
- ✅ `moveParticipant()` - drag-drop between teams (logic)
- ✅ `updateTeamName()` - rename teams
- ✅ `validateTeamParams()` - input validation
- ✅ Fun team name generator (30 emoji names)
- ✅ Color scheme system (10 gradient themes)

**Database Storage (`src/utils/teamStorage.js`)**
- ✅ `saveTeamGeneration()` - persist to database
- ✅ `loadCurrentTeamGeneration()` - fetch latest generation
- ✅ `loadTeamGenerationHistory()` - view past generations
- ✅ `restoreTeamGeneration()` - restore previous generation
- ✅ `deleteTeamGeneration()` - remove generation
- ✅ `updateTeamCaptain()` - update captain in DB
- ✅ `moveParticipantToTeam()` - drag-drop persistence
- ✅ `updateTeamName()` - rename in DB
- ✅ `hasTeamGenerationData()` - check for existing data

#### 3. React Components

- ✅ Member list with hover effects

#### 4. Styling (Name Roulette Design System)
- ✅ Dark navy background (#0A1628)

## 🚧 Phase 2: Next Steps (TODO)

### Immediate Priorities

#### 1. Database Migration
**Before testing, you need to:**
1. Run the migration in Supabase dashboard:
   ```bash
   # Copy contents of supabase/migrations/20250110_squad_scramble.sql
   # Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   # Execute
   ```
2. Verify tables created: `team_generations`, `teams`, `team_members`
3. Check RLS policies are active

#### 2. Testing & Debugging
- [ ] Test session mode (anonymous users)
  - Add participants
  - Generate teams by count
  - Generate teams by size
  - Verify persistence across page reloads
  - Test regenerate functionality
- [ ] Test event mode (logged-in users)
  - Create/load event
  - Generate teams
  - Verify database persistence
  - Check dashboard integration
- [ ] Edge cases:
  - Single participant (should show error)
  - Uneven participant distribution
  - Very large teams (50+ people)
  - Empty participant list

#### 3. Known Issues to Fix
1. **Participant ID mismatch**: Currently using string IDs like `participant-${index}`, but database expects UUIDs. Need to fetch actual participant IDs from database.
2. **Real-time sync**: Not yet implemented for Squad Scramble (works in Wheel)
3. **Drag-drop UI**: Logic exists but no UI for dragging members between teams
4. **Export functionality**: No CSV/copy-to-clipboard yet

#### 4. Missing Features
- [ ] Participant import modal ("Import from Wheel?")
- [ ] Save Results modal (for free tier users)
- [ ] Team generation history viewer
- [ ] Restore previous generation UI
- [ ] Export teams (CSV, clipboard)
- [ ] Real-time sync for multi-device

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Multi-Tool Integration (PLANNED)

### Participant Cross-Pollination
- [ ] Create `ParticipantImportModal.jsx`
  - Detect participants from Wheel
  - Prompt: "Found 12 participants from Name Roulette. Import?"
  - Works bidirectionally (Wheel ↔ Squad Scramble)
- [ ] Update participant loading to be tool-agnostic
- [ ] Shared participant pool architecture

### Shared Components
- [ ] Move `QRCodePanel` to `/components/shared/`
- [ ] Make QR code tool-agnostic (just adds to participant pool)
- [ ] Create `ToolSelector` component for navigation

### Navigation
- [ ] Landing page with tool cards
- [ ] Tool switcher in header
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation

---

## 📋 Phase 4: Event Dashboard Integration (PLANNED)

- [ ] Add "Tools" tab to EventLayout
- [ ] Create ToolsTab component
- [ ] Display tool usage statistics
- [ ] Enable/disable tools per event

---

## 📋 Phase 5: Advanced Features (PLANNED)

### Drag & Drop
- [ ] Install `react-beautiful-dnd` or similar
- [ ] Drag members between teams
- [ ] Visual feedback during drag
- [ ] Persist changes to database

### Generation History
- [ ] View past generations
- [ ] Compare generations
- [ ] Restore previous generation button

### Export Options
- [ ] Copy to clipboard
- [ ] Download CSV
- [ ] Generate PDF report (future)
- [ ] Share via link (future)

### Auto-Save (Free Tier Growth Lever)
- [ ] "Save Results" button in session mode
- [ ] Modal: "Sign up to save your teams!"
- [ ] Create account flow
- [ ] Auto-convert session to event

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Participant ID Issue (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Currently generating local IDs (`participant-${index}`) but need database UUIDs for team_members foreign key.

**Solution**:
```javascript
// In SquadScramblePage.jsx, update loadSessionData:
const namesFromDB = await loadNames();
const participantsFromDB = await loadParticipantsWithIds(); // NEW FUNCTION
setParticipants(participantsFromDB); // Use DB objects with real UUIDs
```

Need to create `loadParticipantsWithIds()` in storage.js:
```javascript
export const loadParticipantsWithIds = async (sessionId = null) => {
  const session = sessionId || getCurrentSessionId();
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('participants')
    .select('id, name, email')
    .eq('session_id', session);

  return data || [];
};
```

### Real-time Sync
Add Supabase subscriptions for `team_generations`, `teams`, and `team_members` tables.

## 📊 Testing Checklist

### Before User Testing
- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Fix participant ID issue
- [ ] Test generation with 2, 5, 10, 20 participants
- [ ] Test both modes (team count, team size)
- [ ] Verify captain selection
- [ ] Test team name editing
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test session persistence
- [ ] Verify event mode integration

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Can users understand the two modes?
- [ ] Is the preview helpful?
- [ ] Do team names feel fun and engaging?
- [ ] Is captain selection intuitive?
- [ ] Does regenerate work as expected?
- [ ] Is the confetti too much/just right?

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Branch Strategy
1. ✅ `feature/squad-scramble` - feature branch (current)
2. Keep committing to this branch as features complete
3. Test thoroughly before merging to `main`
4. Deploy to staging first (if available)
5. Final merge to `main` → production

### Migration Deployment
1. **Staging/Dev**: Run migration, test extensively
2. **Production**: Run migration during low-traffic window
3. **Rollback Plan**: Have reverse migration ready

---

## 📝 Notes for Espen

### What Works Now
- You can navigate to `/squad-scramble` and see the UI
- You can add participants manually
- You can configure team settings (count or size)
- You can generate teams and see them displayed
- Team names can be edited
- Captains can be selected
- Regenerate creates new teams

### What Needs Work (Priority Order)
1. **Database Migration** (CRITICAL) - Run the SQL file in Supabase
2. **Participant IDs** (HIGH) - Fix UUID mismatch issue
3. **Testing** (HIGH) - Verify everything works end-to-end
4. **Participant Import** (MEDIUM) - Cross-tool integration
5. **Drag & Drop** (LOW) - Nice-to-have for UX
6. **Export** (LOW) - Can be added later

### Next Session Plan
1. Run database migration in Supabase
2. Fix participant ID issue
3. Test Squad Scramble standalone
4. Start building ParticipantImportModal
5. Implement cross-tool participant sharing

## 🎉 Achievements So Far

- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns (utils, components, storage)
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ **Design Consistency**: Perfect match with Name Roulette styling
- ✅ **Scalability**: Ready for multi-tool platform expansion
- ✅ **Database Design**: Flexible schema supporting history and both tiers
