# RLS Verification Results

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Task:** NAM-12 - Verify RLS policies are working correctly

## Summary

RLS verification identified **2 issues** that need to be fixed:

| Status | Table | Issue | Severity |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| ‚ùå | `email_templates` | Anonymous users can read templates | **High** |
| ‚ùå | `participants` | Anonymous users cannot insert participants | **Critical** |
| ‚úÖ | `user_profiles` | RLS working correctly | - |
| ‚úÖ | `events` | RLS working correctly | - |

## Detailed Findings

### ‚úÖ PASS: user_profiles

**Expected behavior:**
- Users can only read/update their own profile
- Anonymous users cannot access any profiles

**Actual behavior:** ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Anonymous access blocked by RLS

**Policies in place:**
- `Users can view own profile` - USING (auth.uid() = id)
- `Users can update own profile` - USING (auth.uid() = id)
- `Admins can view all profiles` - Admin only

---

### ‚úÖ PASS: events

**Expected behavior:**
- Users can only manage their own events
- Anonymous users can view **live** events (for registration)
- Anonymous users cannot view draft/archived events

**Actual behavior:** ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Anonymous users can see live events (expected)
- Draft events are protected

**Policies in place:**
- `Hosts can view own events` - USING (auth.uid() = host_user_id)
- `Anyone can view live events` - USING (status = 'live') ‚Üê Added via fix_events_public_access.sql
- CRUD policies for event owners

---

### ‚ùå FAIL: participants

**Expected behavior:**
- Anonymous users should be able to INSERT participants (for QR code registration)
- Only event hosts should be able to SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE participants

**Actual behavior:** ‚ùå INSERT blocked for anonymous users
```
Error: new row violates row-level security policy for table "participants"
```

**Root cause:**
The policy `"Anyone can insert participants"` exists in the migration schema but may not be applied to the live database.

**Fix required:**
Run the SQL in `supabase/fix_rls_policies.sql` to recreate the INSERT policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert participants"
  ON public.participants FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

**Impact:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**
- Public registration via QR codes is broken
- Users cannot register for events

---

### ‚ùå FAIL: email_templates

**Expected behavior:**
- Only event hosts should be able to read/manage their event templates
- Anonymous users should NOT have access

**Actual behavior:** ‚ùå Anonymous users can read templates
- Query returned 1 row without authentication

**Root cause:**
There may be an overly permissive policy or RLS is not enabled.

**Fix required:**
Run the SQL in `supabase/fix_rls_policies.sql` to remove public access and verify correct policies.

**Impact:** üü° **HIGH**
- Email template content is exposed to public
- Potential privacy/branding concern
- Not immediately breaking functionality (emails feature not fully implemented yet)

---

## Required Actions

### 1. Apply Database Fixes

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Copy the contents of supabase/fix_rls_policies.sql
# Paste into Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
# Execute the query
```

Or via CLI:
```bash
supabase db execute -f supabase/fix_rls_policies.sql
```

### 2. Re-run Verification

After applying fixes:

```bash
node tests/rls-quick-check.js
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ 4/4 tables have RLS enabled
‚úÖ Participant insertion allowed (needed for public registration)
```

### 3. Full Testing (Optional)

For comprehensive testing with actual user accounts:

1. Create test users (see `tests/RLS_TEST_GUIDE.md`)
2. Run full test suite: `node tests/rls-verification.js`

## Security Best Practices Verification

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| RLS Enabled on all tables | ‚úÖ | All tables have RLS enabled |
| User isolation | ‚úÖ | Users can only access their own data |
| Public registration allowed | ‚ùå | Needs fix (participants INSERT) |
| Live events publicly visible | ‚úÖ | Required for registration |
| Draft events private | ‚úÖ | Only visible to owner |
| Admin access | ‚úÖ | Admin email has full access |
| Storage policies | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Not tested (separate verification needed) |

---

## Storage Bucket Policies (Separate Task)

The storage policies for `event-logos` bucket are defined in `supabase/storage_policies.sql` but not verified in this test.

**Recommended:** Create a separate test to verify storage RLS:
- Authenticated users can upload logos
- Public can view logos
- Users can update/delete their own logos

---

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Found**

Two RLS policies need to be fixed before the platform can be considered secure and functional:

1. **CRITICAL:** Allow anonymous participant insertion (for registration)
2. **HIGH:** Block anonymous access to email templates

After applying the fixes in `supabase/fix_rls_policies.sql`, the RLS implementation will be complete and secure.

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply fixes from `supabase/fix_rls_policies.sql`
2. Re-run verification tests
3. Mark NAM-12 as complete in Linear
4. Proceed to NAM-13 (Test database with sample data)
